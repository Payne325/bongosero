# Destroy Downtown

A rhythm game in which a giant ape destroys a city.

I began developing this game as a way of pracising developing with the Rust Programming Language and as part of a personal effort to be a bit more creative. The initial plan is to develop a single level for the game in order to focus on fun game play and to not overwhelm myself with making too much art and music for a short solo project.

The game will be controlled using official Nintendo Donkey Konga Bongo controllers. Partially because I think its funny, but also because the controllers are so satisfying to use that they lend themselves well for fun gameplay (especially for a game about smashing stuff).

This is also where the git repository gets its name from ;)

I created all the pixel art myself using <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a>.

## Dependencies
Game can be built with cargo, this will handle all dependencies except libusb.
For Linux distros it is likely you already have this installed.
For Windows you may have to install it <a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows">manually</a>.
