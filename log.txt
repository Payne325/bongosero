Wanted to use gc controller, wasnt supported by quick silver out of the box -> understandable. Carried on with keyboard to develop the game itself.
Decided to handle the controller after.

Spent an afternoon updating to latest quicksilver interface changes.

After that, began focusing on implementing the game with keybaord and mouse controls
