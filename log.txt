Wanted to use gc controller, wasnt supported by quick silver out of the box -> understandable. Carried on with keyboard to develop the game itself.
Decided to handle the controller after.

Spent an afternoon updating to latest quicksilver interface changes.

After that, began focusing on implementing the game with keybaord and mouse controls, being careful to provide a suitable interface for the camera/bongo combination.

November + December + January
Moved away from the game to develop the face capture library as a seperate project. See seperate log for notes

First stab at integrating the face traking controller into bongosero, hooked up to the library ok, but the player sprite jumps around a lot
Need to think of a good way to smooth out movement.
Ideas:
- Keep a running history of bboxes and average out the centre points
- Implement a PID loop
- Implement a "dead zone", so only big enough head movements are recorded
- Some combination of the ideas above...

Took time off to focus on game jam/coding break.
Project has been descoped. This is now a demonstration of the idea of playing a space invader/1942 style shoot em up with head tracking controlling player movement.

Response to ideas for smoothing out movement.
- Dead zone -> Will attempt this first
- Running history -> Good but could be unnecessary, attempt if deadzone fails.
- PID loop -> N/A for this problem, this is ideal for automation problems.
